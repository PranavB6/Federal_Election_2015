    <h1> Analysis </h1>
    <p> In the election the Liberal Party won a majority government with 184 seats (54%). Following them is the Conservative party with 99 seats (29%) and after that is the NDP with 44 seats (13%). Preceding these parties, the Bloc Quebecois won 10 seats (3%) and the Green party won 1 seat (0%). This is a fairly surprising turnout; a lot of people (including me) expected a conservative minority government. However, the liberals earned almost double the votes of the Conservatives. The Conservative negative advertisement strategy towards Justin Trudeau had failed miserably. Many people didn’t necessarily vote for the liberals but rather against the Conservatives. This is an issue related to Canada’s democracy, corruption. The controversial Bill C-51 and the many scandals involving the Conservatives such as the recent Mike Duffy case suggest that the Conservatives, and especially Stephen Harper may be corrupt. Many voters just wanted to get rid of him, and Justin Trudeau seemed to be the next best person. After his defeat, Stephen Harper step down as party leader. He did, however, win his riding, Calgary heritage, by an overwhelming 62% and will be a MLA. More than 68% of eligible voters cast a ballot in this election. This is the highest voter turnout since 1993. It’s amazing that we had such a high turnout than usual, but it’s also terrible because only 68% of the people voted and we still consider that great. This is yet another issue in Canada’s democracy. “The threat to democracy isn’t from some enemy outside, it’s from within,” said Mr. Ginther. If voters become apathetic, and do not take part in democracy and express their views, democracy will fail. We will unknowingly give our power (and money) to those who will take our rights and freedoms.</p>

    <p>In my riding, Calgary Skyview, Darshan Singh Kang of the Liberal party was elected with 46% of the votes. Not far behind, in second place was the Conservative party represented by Devinder Shory with 40 percent of votes, and Sahajvir Singh representing the NDP with 8% of the votes. This is also surprising since Calgary is known to be a very conservative area. </p>
