        <h2>Economy</h2>
        <p> I am currently 16 years old, and do not have a job, so why should what happens to the economy matter to me? Well you see, right now our economy is in a huge recession and my father is unemployed. I would like to see the economy handled well to transition out of this state in a way that benefits my father and a majority of the people. Which is why I strongly agree with the Liberal’s stance on focusing on helping the middle class, unlike Steven harper’s approach to help the rich and hope that will in turn lead to benefitting the middle class. The NDP party plans to roll-back some changes made by the conservatives such as the income-splitting policy for families, and the TFSA contribution limits, and instead spend on things like Infrastructure, and raising minimum wage to $15/hr. Unsurprisingly, the Green Party would like to switch to a more green economy, and also increase minimum wage to $15/hr. While I would like to have a more environmental friendly economy, I think the Green Party would take it too far, and maybe even weaken the economy. Overall, I believe it’s time for change, the conservatives are no longer able to do a good job of handling the economy, and I don’t think the NDP and the Green Party can give us the change we need, so I support the Liberals. </p>

        <h2>Bill C-51</h2>
        <p> Bill C-51 has caught my attention. It is a very controversial bill that has been passed by the conservatives because of their majority government. I believe the bill gives too much power to the government, and needs to be repealed completely. The bill gives government much more power to spy on its people, to share private information of people, and limits expression of freedom because of its vague definition of a terrorist. I agree with the NDP and Green Party’s plans to repeal the Bill. </p>

        <h2>Syria and Iraq Crisis</h2>
        <p> News of the Syria and Iraq Crisis has spread globally. Millions of refugees are fleeing Syria to other countries. Its neighboring countries have a lot of problems of their own and are having trouble taking in so many new immigrants. I believe it is our responsibility to take in some of the refugees. Although I agree that we still need to make sure that we do not take in someone that is a threat to our nation, we need to speed up the process so we can help more people faster. The Conservatives promise to bring 10,000 refugees over four years. That is nowhere near how much we should be doing to help. Although the Green Party said they would do “everything it can,” it did not have a clear goal. I strongly agree with the NDP and the Liberals. The NDP promise to sponsor 10,000 refugees by year’s end and the Liberals plan to accept 25,000 by January 2016. Although the numbers are very different, they both have a similar idea- to accept as many refugees as we can. We are at war with Iraq which has dragged on for a long time now. I do not believe that we should continue the war any longer, but we cannot simply stop helping the people there. The Liberal's view on this matter matches up with mine – to end the bombing campaign in Iraq but keep military trainers in Iraq and boost humanitarian aid to help refugees. </p>

        <h2>Marijuana</h2>
        <p> This is a drug that affects a lot of people especially teenagers whose consumption is only increasing. In the past, the Canadian government considered decriminalizing it, however, Ronald Reagan’s wife had started the “War on Drugs” and the drug remained banned. Research studies show that marijuana is actually less harmful than alcohol and tobacco. If they are legal, then marijuana should be too. It also has medical uses. If there is already lot of users, then the government should legalize it and tax it. This way, the government can control its supply even and obtain revenue from it. The Green Party and Liberal Party agree with my view. The NDP would decriminalize it, and consider legalizing it. The Conservatives are opposed to legalization or decriminalization of marijuana. </p>

        <h2>Environment</h2>
        <p> There are predictions that we will run out of resources such as oil very soon, so it is important to protect what little we have an invest for the future. I agree with a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade program, or a combination of both. This will encourage companies to consider the environmental factor of their product and in turn, drive the economy to be more eco-friendly. As for the pipelines, I believe they can really improve the state of our recession, but it is important to consider the environmental factor for them. In this case, my views line up most with the NDP and the Liberals. </p>
