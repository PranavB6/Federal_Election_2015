          <h2>Syria and Iraq Crisis</h2>
          <p> The Green Party believes that the Conservatives are not doing nearly as much as they can to help. "We need to get back to the kind of country we were where we welcomed people and we didn't allow a humanitarian crisis to be wrapped up in red tape," May said. She would like to see Canada do “everything it can” to help the crisis. However, she has not specified how she will help the refugees.</p>

          <p> Elizabeth May would introduce a carbon fee on fossil fuels. The revenues from this would be returned to all Canadians adults in the form of a carbon dividend.
