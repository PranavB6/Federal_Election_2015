          <h2>Economy</h2>
          <p>The Conservatives “guarantee” low taxes to families, seniors, workers and small businesses by placing a “tax lock.” Some of their main priorities are to create 1.3 million new jobs by 2020, opening new markets for Canadian businesses and workers, and helping 700,000 more Canadians own their own home. They believe that they have “a positive plan for the next four years to protect Canada’s economy, create new, well-paying jobs, and help families and seniors.” </p>

          <h2>Syria and Iraq Crisis</h2>
          <p> The Conservatives promise to bring 10,000 refugees from Syria and Iraq over four years. They introduced a Syrian emergency relief fund that would be sent as humanitarian assistance to Syria. The fund would match donations from Canadians, up to $100 million. They would continue active military action against ISIS in the form of coalition airstrikes to stabilize the region. </p>

          <h2>Marijuana</h2>
          <p> The Conservatives are opposed to legalization or decriminalization of marijuana. They have changed the laws surrounding medical marijuana, by requiring that users order it from a licensed provider rather than growing it themselves. </p>

          <p> Steven Harper is opposed to both a carbon tax and a cap-and-trade program. The Conservatives have contributed $300 million to the UN Green Climate Fund, which helps developing countries battle the effects of climate change. They are committed to strengthening the polluter-pay principle. They have set emissions reduction targets under the Copenhagen Accord, but unless further climate legislation is brought in, Canada is on track to miss those targets. </p>
