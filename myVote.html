    <h3> My Vote: Darshan Singh Kang of the Liberal Party </h3>
    <img src="images/liberal.jpg" width="200" height="200" alt=""/>
    <p> My vote goes to Darshan Singh Kang. It is evident from the "my perspective" page that I strongly favor the Liberals. Most of my views closely line up with their views in every issue. Furthermore, I believe it is important to replace the Conservative government as there have been a number of scandals involving them. The most recent one being the Mike Duffy trial. Mike Duffy was a senator appointed by Stephen harper he face criminal charges related to his improper expense claims. However, there have been many more such as Maxime Bernier, G8 funding, supreme court tussle when Harper attempted to appoint Marc Nadon, and more. The NDP and the Green Party have some views that I agree with, but again, my views are closer to that of the liberals. I believe that Justin Trudeau <u>is</u> ready. Darshan Singh Kang has a lot of experience in politics and community involvement. He has also been an MLA before, I believe he will represent my views well. </p>
